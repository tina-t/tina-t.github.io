        <p>Spoopy Maze is a game where a prince, that has been turned into a frog, goes through mazes to save the princess that had been captured by a ghoul. The prince must go 
        through the maze using the key arrows without touching the wall. If he touches the wall, he will have to go back to where he started. There will be flowers for the 
        prince to collect to gain points. The flowers at the very end of each level will automatically switch to the next level. In addition, there will be a time limit for the 
        player. The player must pass all levels to save the princess before the time ends otherwise they will have to start over.</p>
        <p>1. Some programming concepts or structures I learned in this unit that I applied in my game are sequences, iteration, and event-handling. I used sequence in my game to 
        make an order of commands that will follow the list from top to bottom. In addition, I utilized the event-handling concept and placed it on top of my sequences so that 
        any arrow or the green flag can trigger the sequence of events. I also applied the iteration concept by using it to embrace my sequences so that it notifies the event 
        to loop or how many times to repeat the commands.
        </p>
        <p>2. In the making of the game, I had encountered problems and struggles. I solved these problems by looking back at the sequences of the sprites and backgrounds and 
        finding the mistake. Furthermore, I looked at other games that are similar to the one I was making and looked at their commands to compare. I additionally asked my
        teacher and searched online for help as well.
        </p>
        <p>3. Some aspects that I like best of my game is the part where it asks for you name and the component of when the frog touches the black line, it will go back to the 
        starting point. I also liked the transitions and the motions of the sprites and background changing when the green flag is clicked.
        </p>
        <p>4. If more time was given for me to work more on my game, I would modify the tutorial page because the page takes a while to get through to the first level so I would like 
        to fix that and I would also want to alter the time of the game and the scoring system.
