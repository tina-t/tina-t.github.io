        <p>The recent kidnapping of a high school teen, Jimmy Parker, had occurred recently in town. In this interactive fiction, a young teen named Jeremy Jeon makes decisions that will 
        determine if he gets kidnapped or not.</p>
        <p>1. Some programming concepts or structures I learned in this unit that I applied in my story was how to use while loops as well as how to connect branches from my story map together.
        I learned how to create options with "\t" and how to respond to the options if they are chosen with "\n". In addition, I learned to apply def(), if, and elif conditional statements.</p>
        <p>2. A story I particularly like is Justin's story because it was amusing and simple and his options were clear.</p>
